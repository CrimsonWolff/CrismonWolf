- Welcome to my personal profile! I'm Wolf, a systems development student.
- Here you can find a little about me and my projects, in fact I do some basic things and try to learn as much as I can.
Something I want say before you browse my projects, some codes here are not mine and other I using to learn more, or even improve a personal project.


- At the moment I'm learning to use HTML with CSS and Bootsrap, PHP, Json, Javascript, Delphi (Pascal) and SQL.
I look foward to learning more and becoming more confident with these langs and impoving my skills. I hope to work in this area in the future.

- I want to collaborate on projects where I can learn new things or even game projects, this last one is a initimate desire.
